# The Path to Blockbuster: Navigating the Journey to Box Office Success

**Authors**: David Johnson and Norman Jen

## Overview

This project analyzes the profitability of different film genres at the box office. By examining the performance of various genres in terms of revenue generation, we aim to identify which types of films are currently experiencing the greatest success in the market. This analysis involves studying box office data to understand the financial performance of different genres and their respective profitability metrics. The goal is to provide actionable insights to the head of the company's new movie studio, enabling informed decision-making regarding the types of films to create in order to maximize commercial success.

## Business Problem

The business problem is to determine the optimal strategy for a new movie studio targeting the US market. This involves identifying the most profitable genre of film to produce, as well as the key writers and directors with a track record of success in that specific genre. Additionally, the studio needs to determine the most lucrative time of year for movie releases in terms of profitability. By addressing these questions, the studio aims to maximize its chances of commercial success and establish a strong presence in the competitive US film industry.

## Data

In this analysis, data was sourced from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/) and [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/). The IMDb dataset provides comprehensive details on movies, encompassing information on writers, directors, genres, country of origin, and average ratings for each film. Conversely, the Numbers dataset offers insights into box office performance metrics, such as production budgets and gross domestic revenue. Integrating these datasets offers a holistic understanding of movie performance, enabling analysis of factors influencing box office success.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis. This will provide a useful overview of how successful a movie is.

## Results

The analysis highlights that Animation emerges as the most profitable genre, leading both in domestic and worldwide profit with an average of approximately $32 million and $25 million, respectively. Following closely behind is the musical genre, ranking third in domestic profit at around $25 million. This data strongly suggests that producing animation musicals, akin to successful films like Frozen and Moana, presents a promising opportunity for achieving success and profitability in the movie industry.

The analysis of the graph reveals that movies released during the summer season garnered the highest average domestic profit, indicating that summer releases were the most profitable at the box office, with an average profit of approximately $1.8 million. The data suggests a correlation between the genre preference of Animation and Musical films, which often cater to younger audiences, and the profitability of summer releases. This trend aligns with the fact that summer months coincide with school vacations, making it an opportune time for families and children to attend movies, resulting in higher average domestic profits for these genres during the summer season.

Their impressive track record in crafting successful animated features makes them highly recommended choices for writing projects within the genre.

Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, both renowned directors in the realm of music/animation films, have each helmed three of the top 10 highest-grossing movies domestically within the genre.

On the other hand, Pierre Coffin directed Despicable Me, Despicable Me 2, and Despicable Me 3, generating a domestic profit of $664,203,670.00.
