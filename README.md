**Authors**: David Johnson and Norman Jen

## Overview

This project investigates the operational requirements of [Company/Organization], which [brief description of their mission or primary function]. Utilizing descriptive analysis of [relevant data sources], the study reveals patterns in [key metrics or variables], highlighting areas where resource allocation could be optimized. By identifying [specific findings], [Company/Organization] can make informed adjustments to [relevant processes or strategies] in order to enhance [desired outcome].


This project analyzes the risks associated with specific make and model aircraft. A descriptive analysis of aviation accident data reveals variations in the frequency of fatal incidents among different planes. Additionally, it offers insights into the timing patterns of accidents throughout the year and highlights specific geographical regions within the continental U.S. where airplane accidents are more prevalent. Our recently established aviation school can leverage this analysis to make informed decisions on aircraft investments, pinpoint suitable locations for our operations, and develop well-timed lesson schedules.

## Business Problem

Our company is embarking on establishing a new flight school, with a primary focus on ensuring the safety of our students and bringing up a new generation of pilots. Our business will be broken into two stages for our students. First, the instructional phase where students will learn how to fly with instructor assistance. Second, the rental phase where after completing stage 1, students will be able to rent planes to log solo flight hours to gain their pilot's license. To make informed decisions about the selection of aircraft for our training and rental fleet, we need a clear and visually insightful way to compare the safety records of different aircraft models.

We will specifically investigate the most commonly used aircraft in flight schools. According to the [Pilot Institute](https://pilotinstitute.com/flight-school-aircraft/) and the [Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association](https://www.aopa.org/training-and-safety/learn-to-fly/flying-for-fun/choose-where-to-train/training-aircraft-review#:~:text=Cessna%20172%3A%20The%20Cessna%20172,%2Dinjected%20four%2Dcylinder%20engines.), the top aircraft make and models used in flight school are the Cessna 172, Piper PA-28 Cherokee, Cessna 150, and Cessna 152.
